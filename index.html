      <p>Hi, my name is Wyatt Ogden and I'm from South Jordan, Utah.  
        I'm a student at Neumont College studying web development and design.
        I first got interested in web development when my cousin introduced me 
        to codecademy tutorials learning HTML and CSS over the summer.</p>

          and I enjoy every second I get to be with them.  I feel extremely grateful for the 
          family and friends I've been given.  I look forward to see what my future holds, for now
