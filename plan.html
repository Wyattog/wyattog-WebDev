          <h2>My Plans</h2>
              <p>For now my plans in my life are pretty simple, learn as much
                 knowledge and as many useful skills as I can. In college last semester
                 I learned the hard way the consequences of procrastination so I plan on 
                 staying up-to-date with my assignments and studying to hopefully be able to
                 excel.
              </p>
              <p>In regards to long-term plans I hope to be able to graduate from this certification
                course and be able to find a job that will help me learn and grow and also pay the bills.
                Eventually I'll find my wife, though I don't feel rushed at all to find her but when I do 
                I'm excited to be able to make our family and prosper!
