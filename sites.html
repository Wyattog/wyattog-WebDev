      <h1>My Favorite Sites</h1>
        <p>Below are listed just a couple of my favorite websites.
            If you haven't noticed yet, these websites have a snowboarding
            theme to it. I love watching snowboarding videos except when it's summer
            becuase then they just make me sad.
        </p>
        <p>Backcountry.com is usually my first stop in looking for my snowboarding gear.
            I wouldn't consider myself someone who has a passion for shopping but when
            Backcountry is having a sale I'm always there looking for what I can get for a steal!
